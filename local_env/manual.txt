###extract required Glassfish and copy required JDK folder into local_env###
<GF or Payara>.zip

###using an preconfigured domain or change JDK###
simply import in Eclipse and execute prepare.xml ANT script

###configuring a new local domain###
1   correct values in prepare.properties (extract used zip and copied JDK)
2   validate paths in prepare.xml (must be changed for weblogic, jboss and so on)
3   correct values in local domain in folder domains
4   execute prepare.xml ANT script

###help for Code Compare###
As comparison of application server and JDK will take to much time, simply exclude them in Code Compare.
--> local domain will still be compared, because it's an separate folder

###switch between configuration environments###
simply duplicate the files (domain.xml_PROD,...) and rename with a script for each environment
for application configuration files you can just copy the ones from staging (maybe with different name)
